This is a simple web-site I'm using to collate information and research surrounding the development of web-base VR experiences. That sounded extremely corporate and buzzwordy but I can assure you it's extremely hard to convey information without accidentally attempting to use the original meanings of buzzwords. Who am I? I go Aetous on the internet, I'm a Professional Software Designer & Developer. I've got an interest in the open web and VR/XR applications. A lot of my personal work revolves around pushing limits and exploring accessible technologies. If you ever need to reach me; my preferred contact is over email: aetous@proton.me What can I expect? This is just a place to store my research and thoughts on the various technologies surrounding Project Calzone and my relevant SocialVR projects. I'll do my best to hold the content of this site to an Academic Standard. But no one's grading this and I don't really think anyone will care all that much, so all that means is I'll make an effort to cite all my sources link all my references so that way others can do more research later. How did you make this website? This website is built using Obsidian as an editor with MKDocs as a website framework being hosted by GitHub Pages .","title":"Project Calzone Research"},{"location":"#project-calzone-research","text":"","title":"Project Calzone Research"},{"location":"#what-is-this","text":"This is a simple web-site I'm using to collate information and research surrounding the development of web-base VR experiences.

Ever since VRChat used EasyAnti-Cheat to stop hacking, and subsequently nuking an entire good-faith accessibility modding community without warning over a single weekend, of which I was a good-faith user of, I felt that there really had to possibly be more equitable and ethical ways of doing Social VR that protect users from situations like these. VRChat has since acknowledge their mistake and made better, but my point is still made. If they'll let me I do hope to work with them some day. The Solution (Sort of) The idea of Project Calzone came from combining Social VR with the Federated Social media structure of Mastodon . The idea being that users could be insulated problematic or bad decisions by one or more organizations. I've done small scale technical experiments in the past with a GodotEngine 3 & 4 based client and Express and ASP .Net based backend. But a lot of other important stuff that is necessary for an application such as this was just out of reach. This website is my hope to change that. To give me a playground/gallery to explore, research, experiment, and catalogue various technologies to make it happen. I can't promise that it will one day exist, only that I really really want it too. Why 'Calzone?' It's a nonsense codename, and I like pizza. That's it. I'm serious, it means absolutely nothing.","title":"What is 'Project Calzone'?"},{"location":"What%20is%20Project%20Calzone/#what-is-project-calzone","text":"2/2/2024","title":"What is 'Project Calzone'?"},{"location":"What%20is%20Project%20Calzone/#the-problem","text":"Project Calzone is the codename for an idea that's been kicking around in my head.
