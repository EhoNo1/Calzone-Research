# What is 'Project Calzone'?
*2/2/2024*
## The Problem
Project Calzone is the codename for an idea that's been kicking around in my head. Ever since VRChat used EasyAnti-Cheat to stop hacking, *and subsequently nuking an entire good-faith accessibility modding community without warning over a single weekend, of which I was a good-faith user of,* I felt that there *really* had to possibly be more equitable and ethical ways of doing Social VR that protect users from situations like these. 

VRChat has since acknowledge their mistake and made better, but my point is still made. If they'll let me I do hope to work with them some day.

## The Solution (Sort of)
The idea of Project Calzone came from combining Social VR with the Federated Social media structure of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). The idea being that users could be insulated problematic or bad decisions by one or more organizations. 

I've done small scale technical experiments in the past with a [GodotEngine](https://godotengine.org/) 3 & 4 based client and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [ASP .Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) based backend. But *a lot* of other **important** stuff that is necessary for an application such as this was just out of reach. 

This website is my hope to change that. To give me a playground/gallery to explore, research, experiment, and catalogue various technologies to make it happen. I can't promise that it will one day exist, only that I *really really* want it too.

## Why 'Calzone?'
It's a nonsense codename, and I like pizza. That's it. I'm serious, it means absolutely nothing.
