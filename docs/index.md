# Project Calzone Research
## What is this?
This is a simple web-site I'm using to collate information and research surrounding the development of web-base VR experiences. That sounded extremely corporate and buzzwordy but I can assure you it's extremely hard to convey information without accidentally attempting to use the original meanings of buzzwords.

You can find this website's repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/EhoNo1/Calzone-Research).
## Who am I?
I go by Aetous on the internet, I'm a Professional Software Designer & Developer. I've got an interest in the open web and VR/XR applications. A lot of my personal work revolves around pushing limits and exploring accessible technologies.

If you ever need to reach me; my preferred contact is over email: [aetous@proton.me](mailto:aetous@proton.me)
## What can I expect?
This is just a place to store my research and thoughts on the various technologies surrounding Project Calzone and my relevant SocialVR projects. 

I'll do my best to hold the content of this site to an *Academic Standard.* But no one's grading this and I don't really think anyone will care all that much, so all that means is I'll make an effort to cite all my sources link all my references so that way others can do more research later. Most references I make will be directly linked in text, with any others that I didn't explicitly mention thrown in a 'References' section.
## How did you make this website?
This website is built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) as an editor with [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as a website framework being hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
